<h1>Recipe Page</h1>

<h2>This is my first project for the Odin Project. I ran into some difficulties but
it was an excellent learning experience.</h2>

<h2>I learned how to format the page so that the content is displayed clearly and the links
  are to the appropriate places.</h2>
  
  <p>Some improvements I would like to make in the future are</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Improve the responsiveness on smaller screens with media queries</li>
  <li>Improve the spacing for the ingredients and steps section so that it fits to
    whichever format the user is viewing from</li>
  <li>Add a footer with information on where to contact author of webpage</li>
  
  <h2>All in all, this was a great beginner project to start and I will be modifiying in the future
    as I learn through the Odin Project! Happy coding!</h2>
